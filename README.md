# Cats vs Dogs Classification using SVM

## Overview
This project implements a Support Vector Machine (SVM) model to classify images of cats and dogs. The dataset is sourced from the [Kaggle Cats and Dogs Image Classification dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samuelcortinhas/cats-and-dogs-image-classification). Images are preprocessed and resized, and the SVM model is trained and evaluated for performance.

## Features
- **Binary Image Classification**: Classifies images as either "Cat" or "Dog."
- **Image Preprocessing**: Resizes images to 64x64 pixels and normalizes pixel values.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes an SVM with a linear kernel for classification.
- **Performance Metrics**: Provides accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
